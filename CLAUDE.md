# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an investment research automation project that uses Claude Code as a research assistant. The goal is to gradually automate the investment research workflow, from manual prompt-based assistance to a fully automated AI research analyst system.

### Current Phase: Phase 1 - Manual CC Workflows

The project is currently in the manual workflow phase, focusing on:
- Morning research digest and report summarization
- Watchlist updates and opportunity identification
- Investment strategy application and analysis
- Knowledge organization (reports, strategies, sectors, companies)

## Key Roles for Claude Code

When working in this repository, Claude Code should act as:

1. **Knowledge Organizer**: Classify and organize investment reports, research, and strategies
2. **Junior Research Analyst**: Summarize news/reports, match to investment strategies, identify opportunities
3. **Reasoning Partner**: Connect news, strategy, and market data to generate actionable insights

## Investment Research Workflow

The typical workflow being automated:
1. **Morning Research**: Download and summarize reports from sources (GS Portal, Bloomberg)
2. **Idea Discovery**: Identify interesting stocks and maintain watchlist
3. **Mental Model Analysis**: Apply investment strategies (Mean Reversion, etc.) to evaluate price movements
4. **Deep Research & Decision**: Review financials, valuation, technicals, and make trading decisions

## Pain Points Being Addressed

- **Report Management**: Downloaded reports (e.g., Goldman Sachs) need summarization and organized storage
- **Sector Investment Logic**: Each sector requires a systematic investment framework with structured information organization
- **Trading Strategy**: Rules-based responses to news events and short-term price movements

## Future Phases

- **Phase 2**: Build structured knowledge base (strategies, sector rules, company profiles)
- **Phase 3**: Create automation modules (news summarizer, document classifier, price anomaly detector)
- **Phase 4**: Full AI research analyst agent with end-to-end automation

## Language Context

The primary user works in both English and Chinese. Research materials may come from both English sources (Goldman Sachs, Bloomberg) and Chinese markets. Be prepared to handle bilingual content and switch contexts as needed.
